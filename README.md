---

Apurba is a developer and academic based in <span style = "background-color:#FA8C8C;">Melbourne, Australia</span>. He currently devotes his time towards teaching and building pixel-perfect contraptions for the web. While Apurba thrives on employing JavaScript to create miscellaneous applications, be It a web app, computational art or anything in between, he understands the role psychology-driven human centred design plays in manifesting UI/UX that empathises with the user.

Apurba is passionate about all things multidisciplinary and firmly believes in drawing wisdom from different avenues to solve problems. 

As Uncle Iroh from ATLA puts it:

> “It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If you take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale.”

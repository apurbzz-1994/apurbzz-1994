### Apurba (:neckbeard:/👨🏽‍💻 /🎓)
---

Apurba is a developer and academic based in `Melbourne, Australia`. He currently devotes his time towards `teaching` and building `pixel-perfect` contraptions for the web. While Apurba thrives on employing `JavaScript` to create miscellaneous applications, be It a web app, computational art or anything in between, he understands the role `psychology-driven human centred design` plays in manifesting UI/UX that `empathises` with the user.

Apurba is passionate about all things `multidisciplinary` and firmly believes in drawing wisdom from different avenues to solve problems. 

As Uncle Iroh from ATLA puts it:

> “It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If you take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale.”

**And yes, Apurba is a douche for talking in third person. :man_shrugging:**
